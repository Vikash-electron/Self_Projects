The problem of image superresolution is concerned with taking a low resolution image and then convert it to a high resolution image only using the LR image. This notebook uses SRGAN which is a generative adversarial network that is created for image superresolution. One of the reasons I chose to tackle this problem is because it is an interesting problem that can give someone a lot of insights.
