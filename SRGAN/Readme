The problem of image superresolution is concerned with taking a low-resolution image and then converting it to a high-resolution image only using the LR image. This notebook uses SRGAN, a generative adversarial network created for image super-resolution. One of the reasons I chose to tackle this problem is because it is an interesting problem that can give someone a lot of insight.

You can use this notebook to generate high-resolution images.
I have also provided the different Python files for easy understanding of all the parts of the code.
